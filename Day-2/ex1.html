      <h2>Low and Slow</h2>
      <p>
        This week I am <em>extremely</em> excited about a cooking technique
        called <i>sous vide</i>. In <i>sous vide</i> cooking you submerge the
        food (usually vacuum sealed in plastic) into a wter bath that is
        precisely set to the target temperature you want the food to be cooked
        to. In his book, <i>Cooking for Geeks</i>, Jeff Potter describes it as
        “ultra-low temperature poaching”.

        Next month, we will be serving
        <strong>Sous Vide Salmon with Dill Hollandaise</strong>. To reserve a
        seat at the chef table, contact us before November 30.
